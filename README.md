## Project Overview

This project is a recipe management application built using **React**, **Redux
Toolkit**, **TypeScript**, and **Material UI**. It allows users to search for
recipes, filter them by category, and paginate through the results. The
application demonstrates efficient state management and type safety using modern
web development tools.

## Key Features

- **Recipe Display Table**: Shows a list of recipes fetched from
  [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) with details such as name,
  category, and cuisine.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for recipes by name, updating
  results in real-time.
- **Category Filtering**: Users can filter recipes by category (e.g., Seafood,
  Vegetarian) to narrow down the results.
- **Pagination**: Handles pagination to navigate through a large number of
  recipes efficiently.
- **Redux for State Management**: Manages state for recipes, categories, search
  inputs, filters, and pagination using **Redux Toolkit**.
- **TypeScript for Type Safety**: Ensures type safety across the application to
  prevent runtime errors.
- **Material UI Design**: Implements a clean and responsive user interface with
  a mobile-first approach using **Material UI** components.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For efficient state management and actions.
- **TypeScript**: Enforces strong typing throughout the project.
- **Axios**: For making API calls to
  [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).
